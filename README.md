# Asset Pipeline for Chicago Boss

This document is a work in progress and the code is not finished yet.

## What does it do ?

[Chicago Boss](http://chicagoboss.org) is a fantastic framework. This project attempts to add an asset pipeline à la Rails 3.1.

It will minify, concatenate, statically compress your assets.

These assets are served with a unique name (based on the content md5 hash) and set with far away Expires headers.

This CB application is a supporting application, meant to be installed alongside your application.

It will serve assets from the `priv/assets/javascript/` directory of the app specified in the `assets_for` param in boss.config.

For embbeding, add the following to your application boss.config file along with your app:

```erlang
{ asset_pipeline, [
  {path, "../asset_pipeline"},
  {base_url, "/assets"},
  {assets_for, <YOUR APP>},
  {concatenate, true}, % Values are true, false, and production (production is the default)
  {minify, true}, % Values are true, false, and production (production is the default)
  {dummy, true}
  ]}
```

Don't forget to add asset_pipeline to the list of applications Chicago Boss should start :

    [{boss, [
      {path, "<path to boss>"},
      {applications, [<your app>, cb_admin, asset_pipeline]},

Finally add the asset tags to your custom tags (in `src/view/lib/tag_modules/<app>_custom_tags.erl`) :

```erlang
javascript(Variables, Options) ->
  asset_pipeline_custom_tags:javascript(Variables, Options).
```

(I'm aware this is not as elegant as it should be. Will try and find a workaround.)

In your view :

```dtl
{% javascript src="application.js" %}
```

In your JS files, require other JS files :

```javascript
// = require eventsource.js
// = require rails.js
// = require run.js
```

`require_tree` is not supported at this time.

Start your app, and make [Steve Souders](http://www.stevesouders.com) proud!

## Current state of affairs

Currently only works with JS files. CSS support is coming very soon.

The implementation is very naive at this time. Feedback valued and encouraged.

## Try me quick.

Clone the repo, edit boss.config — I'm pretty sure you'll need to fix the Chicago Boss path.

Start the server :

    init-dev.sh


And visit [http://localhost:8001/assets/home](http://localhost:8001/assets/home).

In your favorite browser inspector, you'll see that the javascript is served first with a `.raw.js` extension without caching headers. But this first request will trigger compression, concatenation and minification, so on the next reload, you'll have `application.a8236b610331fc51b5fec62474325970.js` served, with the correct headers.

Included is also the asset watcher which will automatically reload assets as files are modified.

## Future plans

Add support for stylesheets and images.

Add `require_tree` and other unsupported keywords.

Pass assets through the DTL compiler

Add support for less, sass and coffeescript.

Automatically deploy assets to S3/CloudFront and serve them transparently.
